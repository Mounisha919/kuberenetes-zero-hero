# 🏗️ Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## 🍱 Monolithic Architecture – The "Thali Meal" Analogy

In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application are built and deployed as a **single unit**.

### 🧠 Analogy: Traditional Thali (Plate Meal)

* All items (rice, curry, dessert, etc.) are served on **one plate**.
* If one item is missing or spoils, the **entire meal experience** is affected.
* The **chef prepares everything together**.
* Updating one item (e.g., replacing dessert) means **reworking the whole plate**.

### ✅ Pros

* Easy to develop initially
* Simple to deploy
* Good for small applications

### ❌ Cons

* Hard to scale individual components
* Difficult to update/maintain specific features
* One error can impact the entire system

---

## 🍔 Microservices Architecture – The "Food Court" Analogy

In microservices architecture, the application is broken into **independent services**, each running in its own process and communicating via APIs.

### 🧠 Analogy: Food Court

* Different counters serve different items (biryani, juice, dessert).
* If one counter fails, others still work.
* You can **update, scale, or replace** one counter without touching the others.
* Services can use **different technologies/languages**.

### ✅ Pros

* Independent scaling and deployment
* Easier to maintain and upgrade services
* Fault isolation (one service fails, rest continue)
* Teams can work on different services simultaneously

### ❌ Cons

* More complex infrastructure
* Requires inter-service communication
* Needs better monitoring and orchestration

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature           | Monolithic (Thali)      | Microservices (Food Court)             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Structure         | Single codebase/unit    | Multiple independent services          |
| Scaling           | Entire app together     | Scale individual services              |
| Deployment        | One deployment          | Independent deployments                |
| Fault Isolation   | One failure affects all | Failures isolated to single services   |
| Technology Stack  | One tech stack          | Different techs per service possible   |
| Development Speed | Fast for small teams    | Fast for large teams with coordination |

---

## 📌 Conclusion

* Use **Monolithic** for small apps, MVPs, or simpler systems.
* Use **Microservices** for large, scalable, distributed systems with multiple teams.

# ☸️ Kubernetes Architecture (Diagram-Based Explanation)

## 🧱 What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A **Kubernetes Cluster** is a group of servers (nodes) that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes. It includes:

* **One or more Master (Control Plane) Nodes** – manage the cluster
* **Multiple Worker Nodes** – run your actual applications (pods)
* A **CNI (Container Network Interface)** for communication between all pods and nodes

---

## 📍 Main Sections in the Diagram

### 🔷 1. **Control Plane (Master Node)**

This is the **brain of the cluster**, responsible for maintaining the desired state and making scheduling decisions.

#### Components:

| Component                     | Description                                                            | Analogy                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **API Server**                | Entry point for all commands and communications (`kubectl`, UI, CI/CD) | Reception/Team Lead        |
| **etcd**                      | Key-value store used to store the **state** of the cluster             | Logbook                    |
| **Scheduler**                 | Decides **which pod goes to which node** based on resources            | Airport Gate Assignment    |
| **Controller Manager**        | Ensures the desired state (e.g., always 3 replicas) is maintained      | Project Manager/Supervisor |

> **Note**: You can interact with the Control Plane using `kubectl`.

---

### 🔷 2. **Worker Node** (Node 1, Node 2)

These nodes **actually run your applications** in the form of **pods**. Each worker node has its own components.

#### Components:

| Component                      | Description                                                          | Analogy                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Kubelet**                    | Communicates with the control plane; runs pods as instructed         | Ground Staff                    |
| **Service Proxy** (Kube Proxy) | Handles networking and forwarding requests to the correct pods       | Traffic Controller              |
| **Pods** (containers inside)   | The smallest unit in Kubernetes. It runs your application containers | Flights carrying app containers |

---

### 🧪 3. **kubectl**

A command-line tool to **interact with the Kubernetes API Server**.

> For example:
> `kubectl get pods` → Talks to API server → Which checks etcd & node state → Returns result.

---

### 🌐 4. **CNI Network (Weave, Calico, etc.)**

This layer ensures that all **pods across all nodes** can communicate. It forms a **cluster-wide network**.

> E.g., Pod on Node 1 can talk to a Pod on Node 2 via the CNI.

---


## 📌 Flow of a User Request (as shown in diagram)

1. User runs `kubectl apply` or any command.
2. **kubectl** sends it to the **API Server**.
3. API Server stores/reads the state from **etcd**.
4. **Scheduler** decides where to deploy the pod (Node 1, Node 2).
5. **Controller Manager** ensures the pod is created/maintained.
6. **Kubelet** on the selected node pulls the container and runs the pod.
7. **Service Proxy (Kube Proxy)** manages communication.
8. The **CNI network** allows pod-to-pod communication across nodes.
9. User accesses the application via **Service or Ingress** (not shown in diagram).

---

## 🛫 Pod-Level Example

Let’s say you deploy an NGINX app:

* A pod is created on **Node 2**.
* **Kubelet** starts the NGINX container.
* **Kube Proxy** ensures traffic to the service reaches this pod.
* If the pod crashes, **Controller Manager** ensures a new one is created.

# ☸️ Kubernetes Cluster Setup Methods

## 🧰 Ways to Create a Kubernetes Cluster

### 1. **Kubeadm**

* **Purpose**: Manually set up a production-like Kubernetes cluster
* **Usage**: Mostly used in cloud VMs or on-premise
* **Flexibility**: High, but you need to install and configure components manually (etcd, API Server, Kubelet, etc.)
* **Good for**: Learning cluster internals or customized production setups

> 📦 You install everything (like building a car from parts)

---

### 2. **Minikube** (Local/EC2)

* **Purpose**: Set up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine or EC2
* **Usage**: Ideal for testing and local development
* **Technology**: Uses VirtualBox, Docker, or EC2 as the underlying VM/host
* **Good for**: Beginners and offline local development

> 🧪 Simulates a cluster on your laptop for practice or testing

---

### 3. **KIND** (Kubernetes IN Docker)

* **Purpose**: Run Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers
* **Usage**: Quick, lightweight way to test Kubernetes behavior
* **Features**:

  * Faster than Minikube
  * Easy CI/CD testing with GitHub Actions
* **Good for**: Devs, testers, and CI pipelines

> 🐳 Cluster inside Docker containers — no VMs needed

---

### 4. **Managed Kubernetes Services**

#### ➤ **EKS (AWS)**

#### ➤ **AKS (Azure)**

#### ➤ **GKE (Google Cloud)**

* **Purpose**: Fully managed Kubernetes clusters provided by cloud vendors
* **Benefits**:

  * No need to manage master/control plane
  * Auto-scaling, monitoring, high availability
* **Good for**: Production workloads

> ☁️ You focus on deploying apps, cloud takes care of the rest

Here’s the full code shown in your image for a Kubernetes **KIND cluster** setup (Kubernetes IN Docker):

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    image: kindest/node:v1.31.2
  - role: worker
    image: kindest/node:v1.31.2
  - role: worker
    image: kindest/node:v1.31.2
  - role: worker
    image: kindest/node:v1.31.2
  - role: worker
    image: kindest/node:v1.31.2
extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
```

### 🔍 Explanation (in README style)

#### 📌 What is this?

This is a YAML configuration file used to **create a local multi-node Kubernetes cluster using KIND** (Kubernetes IN Docker). It defines one control plane and four worker nodes with port mappings to access services on standard HTTP and HTTPS ports.

---

### 🧱 Components

#### 🔹 `kind: Cluster`

Defines that you're creating a KIND cluster.

#### 🔹 `apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4`

Specifies the API version for the KIND cluster configuration.

#### 🔹 `nodes:`

List of all nodes in the cluster.

##### - `role: control-plane`

This node is the **master node** responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster (scheduling, API server, etc.)

##### - `role: worker`

These are the **worker nodes** where your application pods run.

##### - `image: kindest/node:v1.31.2`

Defines the **Kubernetes version** for the node using Docker image tag `v1.31.2`.

#### 🔹 `extraPortMappings`

Maps container ports to host machine ports so that services in the cluster can be accessed from your browser or curl on your laptop.

```yaml
- containerPort: 80
  hostPort: 80
  protocol: TCP
```

This allows you to access any Kubernetes service running on port 80 inside the cluster directly from your host using `localhost:80`.

---

### ⚙️ How to Use

1. Save the file as `kind-cluster.yaml`.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-cluster.yaml
```

That’s it! You’ll have a **5-node KIND cluster** up and running locally with port mappings.
